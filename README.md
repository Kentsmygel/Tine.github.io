    <h2>My Architectural "Masterpieces" (Pending Approval)</h2>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>The Leaning Tower of Regret</h3>
      <img src="images/leaning_regret.jpg" alt="Leaning Tower of Regret" />
      <p>A bold statement in architectural design (and physics). This tower leans not because of gravity, but because it’s always thinking about all its life choices.</p>
      <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> It's now the city’s number one tourist destination... for construction inspectors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>The "Definitely Not Haunted" Mansion</h3>
      <img src="images/haunted_mansion.jpg" alt="Definitely Not Haunted Mansion" />
      <p>This Gothic masterpiece whispers elegance by day, and just… whispers… by night. Nothing to worry about. Except maybe the ghosts.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> No refunds on tours after dark.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>The Invisible Skyscraper</h3>
      <img src="images/invisible_skyscraper.jpg" alt="Invisible Skyscraper" />
      <p>Revolutionary in its design, this skyscraper uses cutting-edge technology to be completely invisible. Unfortunately, so are its tenants and profits. We think it’s still there... but it’s hard to tell.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>The Budget Balloon House</h3>
      <img src="images/balloon_house.jpg" alt="Balloon House" />
      <p>Inspired by a certain animated movie, this house was designed to float. But let's just say the 'budget' balloon didn’t lift quite as high as we thought. It's now a very fancy shed.</p>

    <h2>About Me: The Architect, The Myth, The Coffee Addict</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm [Your Name], a visionary architect (according to my mom) with a passion for bold designs, strong coffee, and slightly questionable structural integrity. My designs have been described as 'daring', 'unique', and occasionally 'oops'.</p>
    <p>When I'm not pushing the limits of what buildings should (or shouldn’t) do, I enjoy taking long walks through IKEA and explaining to my plants why they keep dying in my office. I’ve won multiple awards, mostly for participation, and my buildings have been featured in prestigious publications, like "Interesting Buildings Monthly" and "That One Construction Blog."</p>
    <p>Why hire me? Well, if you want a building that’s never boring (or sometimes even standing), I’m your architect!</p>
